Cluster:  refers to a collection of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together to perform tasks. These clusters are designed to store and process large volumes of data efficiently.

**OLTP:** OLTP, or Online Transaction Processing, refers to the process of managing and executing transaction-oriented tasks in real-time. Think of it as the backbone of everyday business operations, where transactions such as sales, inventory updates, and customer interactions are swiftly processed.

**Advantages:**

1. Real-time data processing enables quick decision-making.
2. Ensures data integrity and consistency.
3. Supports concurrent access by multiple users.

**Limitations:**

1. Optimized for transaction processing rather than complex analytics.
2. May face scalability challenges with a high volume of transactions.
3. Limited historical data storage capacity.

**Common OLTP systems:**

MySQL

Oracle Database

PostgreSQL

Microsoft SQL Server

IBM DB2

**OLAP:** OLAP(Online Analytical Processing), focuses on analyzing large volumes of data to extract insights and support decision-making. Unlike OLTP, which emphasizes real-time transaction processing, OLAP is geared towards aggregating and summarizing data for in-depth analysis.

**Advantages:**

1. Enables multidimensional analysis for deeper insights.
2. Supports complex queries and ad-hoc reporting.
3. Facilitates trend analysis and forecasting.

**Limitations:**

1. Typically slower in processing real-time data compared to OLTP.
2. Requires substantial computing resources for processing large datasets.
3. May struggle with handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

**Common OLAP systems:**

Amazon Redshift

Snowflake

Google BigQuery
